## Motivation

After about 7 months of internship at a AI company, I was fascinated with what
a group of capable software engineers could do. I wanted to carry out similar
experiences when I come back to school. There are opportunities like
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs, but these are more research oriented,
so I looked for more implementation oriented, or product oriented projects.
Surprisingly, I found that majority of my friends lack sufficient knowledge to
understand the core findings in many of the recent papers or read and understand
open source project codes; still, a lot of them was eager to learn more about
AI and ML. This led me to just start a study group myself, targeting Korean students
at my univ.

## Design

Because of the COVID-19 situation, the study had to remain online. Also, the target
of the study was not experienced developers but rather beginner or novice, so the
study would have to remain mostly teacher-student based manner. I found 2 other
members capable of taking the role of teacher, and started to desing the syllabus
of this study.

The plan was to meet 2 hours per week for a semester, talk about basics of ML
theory and its implementation in code. Then in the second semester, we would each
split into teams and undergo projects.

### Coverage
The topics covered were roughly:

* Python Basics
* Python Applications (String manipuation, for loop vs list comprehension, numpy, etc.)
* Linear Algebra basics (vectorization, understanding shapes)
* ML basics (Visualizing matrix computation as neural network and vice verse,
  basics of gradient descent, vectorize such code in NumPy, etc.)
* Deep Learning Codes (building simple keras models)

The Materials are provided through group notion, which is private. :smile:
### Projects

After covering the basics, we started doing projects in 3 teams:
a Kaggle challenge, CV related project, and a Paper reviewing study in NLP domain.
Each of the teaching member took responsibility of one project, and leading the
process of them. I am participating and supervising the paper review study team,
since I have the most interest and experience in the NLP domain. The team is
currently reviewing recent trends in NLP: we started off from a sequence to sequence
model, then attention, and now we are trying to implement Transformer model
ourself.

## What I have Learned..

Many things did not go as planned. We received feedback during the winter break
period about the study in general, and the responses showed that although they
were able to grasp the concepts, when they are asked to really write codes to
implement them, they wouldn't be able to do it. Here comes the first learning
outcome: **For efficient teaching, exercise is very important**. Throughout the
study, we designed only 2 exercises for the other members to participate. More
hands-on experiences would have been better.

Also, it was difficult to explain mathematical concepts without whiteboard :anguished:!
I tried my best to make use of Latex syntax and codes to make myself clear, but
they are not as intuitive and interactive as realtime whiteboard experience.
