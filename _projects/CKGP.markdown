This project is not yet made public, as there exists anonymity period to the
EMNLP 2021 submissions. Just a simple few highlights:

1. I was able to participate in the research paper as a 3rd author
2. I was able to carry out different experiments including model architecture,
   novel model development, hyper parameter tuning, etc.
3. I was able to read many papers in commonsense knowledge field in NLP and
   understand what constitutes a well written paper. Also, how to compare different
   ideas and selecting good ideas to try out.
4. Get familiar with Graph Neural Network models and customizing them.
