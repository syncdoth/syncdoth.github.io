## Year 1

### 2017-2018 Fall

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| COMP 1021  | 3      |  Pretty basic and good introduction to programming in general. |
| ELEC 1200  | 4      |  Good introduction to signal processing with interesting lab exercies. |
| HUMA 2103  | 3      |  Never thought that UST would have music course, but this course helped a lot in my music composition skills.  |
| LANG 1002A | 3      |  Mandatory English language class. |
| MATH 2111  | 4      |  Intro. to linear algebra. The course contents are ok, but you can make sense of the materials only after using them in real life, e.g. ML. |


### 2017-2018 Spring

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| IELM 2200  | 3      | Now called IEDA 2200. Interesting introduction to operation management. |
| LIFS 2040  | 3      | The infamous Cell Biology. I liked the course content, but the materials are not very well organized.  |
| LANG 1003A | 3      | Another mandatory English language class. |
| MATH 2411  | 4      | Applied stat. Cannot really make sense of them until you use them. |

### 2017-2018 Summer

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| CIVL 1160  | 3      | Moderate S&T SSC course. It was actually fun doing project out in HK downtown. |
| COMP 1029C | 1      | A bridging course to C. TBH, not very useful. |
| LIFS 1020  | 3      | Intro to health. The contents are understandable, but the grades are not. |

## Year 2

### 2018-2019 Fall

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| COMP 2012H | 5      | Famous for huge workload. Very hard, but rewarding. |
| COMP 2711H | 4      | Good instructor and good content. Would recommend Honors version of the course. |
| HUMA 1000A | 3      | Famous for light workload. Content is interesting. |
| LANG 2030  | 3      | Another mandatory English class, but it actually teaches technical writings, which is quite useful. |

### 2018-2019 Spring

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| COMP 2611  | 4      | Basic computer organization. Need to memorize many archtectural designs. |
| COMP 4441  | 3      | Computer Music. Fun course throughout, but the grading is quite subjective. |
| HUMA 2104  | 3      | Music Theory course. Should be interested in music to take this course. |
| ISOM 2310  | 3      | Not a bad course for common core, but the contents are not very exciting. |
| LIFS 3240  | 3      | Introduction to Neurobiology. Very interesting neuroscience course, equipped with good contents and teaching materials. |


### Study Leave (2019-2020 Fall ~ 2019-2020 Spring)

## Year 3

### 2020-2021 Fall

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| COMP 3111H | 4      | Software Engineering Course. IMO, it focuses on too much theory. It is a shame that students do not really learn how to use git in this course.. |
| COMP 3711H | 4      | Very challenging assignments and high workload. It is all about mathematical proof of algorithms. Still, the grading is fair, and quite rewarding. |
| COMP 3511  | 3      | Operation System course. This is also too much theoretical. Some more hands-on experience with Linux would have made this course better. |
| COMP 4211  | 3      | Basic Machine Learning. The teaching and course contents are not bad, although a little bit more mathematical proof would have been good also. |
| COMP 4901k | 3      | A NLP course that focuses on ML approaches. Good content with good balance with high level tech and mathematical theory. |

### 2020-2021 Spring (Current)

| Course     | Credit | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| BIEN 1010  | 3      | Intro to Bioengineering. Easy to ace, if you put decent enough of work into it. |
| COMP 4332  | 3      | Big Data Mining Course. Main focus was information retrieval and the utility of ML for that purpose. |
| COMP 4641  | 3      | Social Network Analysis course. Very interesting concepts are introduced including network (graph) analysis. |
| LANG 1122  | 3      | Chinese level 3: much harder than it seems... :sweat: |

## Year 4

### 2021-2022 Fall
