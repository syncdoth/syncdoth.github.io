My name is Sehyun Choi, a final student at HKUST.

I have huge interest in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**,
and planning to pursue a higher degree after my bachelor's degree. My major
interest lies in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Recently,
I am growing my interest in **Explanable AI (XAI)**, and its' applications to NLP.

This website is dedicated to the purpose of showcasing my experiences in
coursework, industries, and research without the confinement of CV format.

You can also take a look at my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
