I have a huge interest in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**,
and planning to pursue a higher degree after my bachelor's degree. My major
interest lies in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I am also interested
in AI safety or **trustworthy AI** direction, including **eXplainable AI (XAI)**,
**privacy**, **fairness**, and **robustness**.

My current main research focus is something I call **"inference-time optimization"**.
Language Models have come a long way, and they are extremely strong nowadays. However,
their behaviors are strongly dependent on the training dataset's property. It is
impossible to design dataset that is "perfect", so they will always exhibit undesired
attributes. I believe this can be mitigated by **optimizing the model or the decoding**
**algorithm at the test time** for given constraints / desiderata (objectives).

My major research questions are:

1. Inference time optimization
2. constraint modeling
3. Knowledge Grounding
4. compositional generalization

This website is dedicated to the purpose of showcasing my experiences in
coursework, industries, and research without the confinement of CV format.
