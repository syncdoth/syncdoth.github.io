<h2 class="year">20.10 ~ </h2>
<h3>HKUST KSA ML Study group</h3>
<h8>Founding Senior Member</h8>
<ul>
  <li>The github link can be found <a href="https://github.com/syncdoth/HKUST-KSA-ML-Study">here</a>.</li>
  <li>This is a ongoing project with other Korean students in HKUST to study ML together.</li>
  <li>For the most part, me and 2 other friends did the teaching of basic ML concepts, and
  we have moved on to the team project phase. We aim to achieve 3 projects done by the end
  of June 2021: a Kaggle challenge, CV related project, and a Paper reviewing study in NLP
  domain.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="year">20.8</h2>
<h3>RNN for Biological Neural Networks</h3>
<h8>Research Assistant</h8>
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed FORCE and Full-FORCE algorithms used for training RNN for biological
  modeling purposes.</li>
  <li>Implemented FORCE (Sussillo and Abbott 2009) and Full-FORCE (DePasquale et all 2018)
  algorithms, and compared their plausibility with a conventional RNN structure:
  LSTM in this case.</li>
  <li>Reproduced the findings of the [Andalman et all, 2019, Neuronal Dynamics Regulating Brain and Behavioral
State Transitions]: the dataset was not public, so synthetic data was used.
Although the results are not very satisfactory, the attempts can be found
<a href="https://github.com/syncdoth/FORCE-RNN">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
