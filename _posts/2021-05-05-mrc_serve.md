description: How to serve pretrained language models provided from Pororo library by Kakao Brain Corp. with torchserve.
---

Recently, Kakao Brain Corp. has released a very interesting open source library
called `Pororo`, named after a very famous Korean animation character. This
library provides various number of natural language related models and APIs to
easily apply them to your services, especially for Korean applications.

One complication is that the level of abstraction is a double edged sword:
it allows for easy usage, but it hinders manual tweaking. My purpose here is to
serve their model: which means that I would have to track down towards their
actual model save file and prediction logics, etc. Let get to it.

## Specifications and Dependencies

The library is mainly built on 2 packages: `fairseq` and `transformers`, which
both is based on `PyTorch` framework. Therefore, `torchserve` will be used to
serve these models.

The details are actually provided in the `README` of the following
